<a id="microservices" class="anchor" href="#microservices" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Microservices</h1>

      <p>A Microservice-based architecture divides software systems
      into many small services which can be deployed
      independently. Every team works on its own Microservices and is
      thus decoupled from other teams. This allows to easily scale
      agile processes. The modularization into Microservices protects
      the system against architecture decay. Consequently, systems
      based on Microservices stay maintainable in the long term. In
      addition, legacy systems can be migrated to Microservices
      without having to change the legacy code. Moreover, Continuous
      Delivery is easier to implement in Microservice-based
      systems. The book is translated from German, see <a
      href="http://microservices-buch.de">http://microservices-buch.de</a>. There
      is also a <a href="http://acornpub.co.kr/book/microservices">Korean translation</a>.</p>

      <p>Eberhard Wolff's book offers a comprehensive introduction to Microservices. It covers:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Advantages and disadvantages of the Microservice approach</li>
	<li>Microservices vs. SOA (Service-oriented Architecture)</li>
	<li>The architecture of Microservice-based systems</li>
	<li>The architecture of individual Microservices</li>
	<li>Impact on project organization, operation, testing and deployment</li>
	<li>Nanoservices</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The book explains technology-neutral concepts and
      architectures which can be implemented with various
      technologies. As an example a concrete Java technology stack is
      shown with Spring Boot, the Netflix stack and Spring Cloud.</p>

      <p>On the basis of many examples and concrete scenarios you will
      learn how Microservices can be used as effectively as
      possible. You will also get suggestions how to deepen what you
      have learned through your own experiments.</p>

      <p>The book also contains essays by Microservices experts.</p>

      <p>This is what readers say about the original German edition of the
      book:</p>
      
      <p>Surprisingly, the best book on Microservices is in German:
"Microservices" by @ewolff<br

Fritschi </a> </p>

      <p> For IT topics I usually prefer English literature, but I
      really recommend "Continuous Delivery" and "Microservices" by
      @ewolff. <br/> <a
